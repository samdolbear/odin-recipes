# Project: Recipes

This is a website to list some recipes I like and make relative links to pages containing the actual recipes. It will test my ability to make good commits that are atomized and concise. Basic web building skills learnt from the prior lessons will also be tested. For instance, structuring the html pages correctly, correct usage of commands and images.
